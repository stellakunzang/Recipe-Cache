# Dog Food Recipe: Version 1

## Ingredients

4 lb turkey (braised)
2 cans pumpkin
4 large apples
3 crowns broccoli (steamed)
half bag kale
half bag frozen blueberries

## Instructions

1. Braise turkey.
2. Steam broccoli.
3. Chop ingredients into manageable chunks.
4. Combine fruits, vegetables, turkey.
5. In quart size freezer bag add 2 cups of food.

### Notes
* I ended up using 1 bag to feed Honey Pie 3 meals. This has not been exact. 
* I had to add the turkey separately because I didn't have a large enough mixing bowl. It was extremely difficult to adequately mix everything together and her meals were likely not a consistent mixture.
