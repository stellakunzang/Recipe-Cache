# Dog Food Recipe: Version 2

## Ingredients

5 lb turkey (braised)
2 cans pumpkin
4 1/2 small apples
2 crowns broccoli (steamed)
1 bunch kale (stem removed)
1 celery heart
half bag frozen blueberries
3 carrots

## Instructions

1. Braise turkey.
2. Steam broccoli.
3. Chop ingredients into manageable chunks.
4. Combine all fruits and vegetables and set aside.
6. Combine fruits, vegetables, turkey.
5. In quart size freezer bag add 2 cups of food.

### Notes
* I ended up using 1 bag to feed Honey Pie 3 meals. This has not been exact.
* I had to add the turkey separately because I didn't have a large enough mixing bowl. It was extremely difficult to adequately mix everything together and her meals were likely not a consistent mixture.
