# Dog Food Recipe: Version 3

## Ingredients

5 lb turkey (braised)
2 cans pumpkin
5 small pink lady apples
half bag broccoli (steamed)
half bag kale
5 large stalks of celery
half bag frozen blueberries

## Instructions

1. Braise turkey.
2. Steam broccoli.
3. Chop ingredients into manageable chunks and load up food processor.
4. Combine all fruits and vegetables and set aside.
5. Liquify turkey in food processor.
6. Combine two mixtures in large bowl.
7. Freeze 1/2 portions in muffin tin. Once frozen solid, pop them out and store them in gallon size freezer bag.

### Notes
* This recipe made 54 patties.
* Transition 3 patties to fridge per day. It takes 48 hours for them to soften completely so will need 2 days patties in circulation. Currently feeding 1 patty in the morning and 2 at night, with 1/2 cup dry food each serving.
* Next iteration I plan to freeze 1/2 cup patties in a stack, separated by parchment paper. The muffin tin idea was cute, but time consuming.
